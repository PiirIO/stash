    Saves a set of files for later use on any node/workspace in the same Pipeline run like the regular <code>stash</code>. The files get discarded after the job, but can be kept with <code>preserveStashes()</code>.
    Using this stash, can slow down CPU power if big sized files (>100MB) get stashed without Compression. Special use cases for uncompressed stashes are small files which have to be stashed very fast.
